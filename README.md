# Unemployment-Analysis-during-covid-19
I analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment and employment in India for the year 2020. Hereâ€™s a summary of my work:

1. Data Exploration & Refinement: Ensured the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough EDA and visualized the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. Key Findings: The analysis revealed that the unemployment rate was significantly higher in the North and East regions of India, particularly in Haryana, Tripura, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Delhi during 2020.
